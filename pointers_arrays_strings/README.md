# Pointers, arrays and strings.
### Pointers are variables which contains a memory address.
### An array is a variable that can store multiples values. In order for the values to be stored togethers, they have to be of the same data type.
### String in C are a sequence of characters terminated with a null character ‘\0’. Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a unique character ‘\0’.
### Table of contents:
***0-reset_to_98.c***

<sub>Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.</sub>

***1-swap.c***

<sub>Write a function that swaps the value of two integers.</sub>

***2-strlen.c***

<sub>Write a function that returns the length of a string.</sub>

***3-puts.c***

<sub>Write a funcction that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.</sub>

***4-print_rev.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.</sub>

***5-rev_string.c***

<sub>Write a function that reverses a string.</sub>

***6-puts2.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.</sub>

***7-puts_half.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. The function should print the second half of the string. If the number of characters is odd, the function should print the last n characters of the string, where n = (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2.</sub>

***8-print_array.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line. Where n is the number of elements of the array to be printed. Numbers must be separated by comma, followed by a space. The numbers should be displayed in the same order as they are stored in the array.</sub>

***9-strcpy.c***

<sub>Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte (\0), to the buffer pointed to by dest. Return value: the pointer to dest.</sub>
