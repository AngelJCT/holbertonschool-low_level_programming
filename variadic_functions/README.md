# Variadic functions
### These are functions that can take a variable number of arguments. In C programming, a variadic function adds flexibility to the program. It takes one fixed argument and then any number of arguments can be passed. The variadic function consists of at least one fixed variable and then an ellipsis(...) as the last parameter.

***0-sum_them_all.c***

<sub>Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters. If n == 0, return 0.</sub>

***1-print_numbers.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
Where separator is the string to be printed between numbers and n is the number of integers passed to the function.
You are allowed to use printf.
If separator is NULL, don’t print it.

***2-print_strings.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
where separator is the string to be printed between the strings and n is the number of strings passed to the function.
You are allowed to use printf.
If separator is NULL, don’t print it.
If one of the string is NULL, print (nil) instead.
Print a new line at the end of your function.</sub>

***3-print_all.c***

<sub>Write a function that prints anything.
Where format is a list of types of arguments passed to the function:
c: char
i: integer
f: float
s: char * (if the string is NULL, print (nil) instead,
