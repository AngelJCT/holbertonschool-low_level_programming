# C - argc, argv
### argc (ARGument Count) is int and stores number of command-line arguments passed by the user including the name of the program. So if we pass a value to a program, value of argc would be 2 (one for argument and one for program name).
### argv(ARGument Vector) is array of character pointers listing all the arguments.
### Table of contents:
***0-whatsmyname.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line. If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again.</sub>

***1-args.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it. Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.</sub>

***2-args.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints all arguments it receives. All arguments should be printed, including the first one. Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line.</sub>

***3-mul.c***

<sub>Write a program that multiplies two numbers. Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line. You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer. If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1.</sub>

***4-add.c***

<sub>Write a program that adds positive numbers. Print the result, followed by a new line. If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line. If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1. You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int.</sub>
