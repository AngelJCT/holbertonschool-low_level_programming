# Recursion
### Recursion is the process of repeating items in a self-similar way. In programming languages, if a program allows you to call a function inside the same function, then it is called a recursive call of the function. The C programming language supports recursion, i.e., a function to call itself. But while using recursion, programmers need to be careful to define an exit condition from the function, otherwise it will go into an infinite loop.

<sub>Write a function that prints a string in reverse.</sub>

<sub>Write a function thatt returns the length of a string.</sub>

***3-factorial.c***

<sub>Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number. If n is lower than 0, the function should return -1 to indicate an error. Factorial of 0 is 1.</sub>

<sub>Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y. If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1.</sub>

***5-sqrt_recursion.c***

<sub>Write a function that returns tha natural square root of a number. If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1.</sub>
