# Functions, nested loops
### A function is a group of statements that together perform a task. A function declaration (function prototype) tells the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters. A function definition provides the actual body of the function.
### Nesting of loops is the feature in C that allows the looping of statements inside another loop. Any number of loops can be defined inside another loop, i.e., there is no restriction for defining any number of loops.
