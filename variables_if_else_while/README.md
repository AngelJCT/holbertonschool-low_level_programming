# Variables, if, else, while.
### Variable is the name of a memory location that we use for storing data. We can change tha value of a variable and reuse it multiple times.
### If and else statements are used to perform the operations based on some specific condition. The operations specified in if block are executed if and only if the given condition is true. With no if there can't be an else.
### A while loop in C programming repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given condition is true. When the condition becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.

***0-positive_or_negative.c***

<sub>This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative. The variable n will store a different value every time you will run this program. The output of the program should be: The number, followed by: if the number is greater than 0: is positive, if the number is 0: is zero, if the number is less than 0: is negative. Followed by a new line.</sub>>

***1-last_digit.c***

<sub>This program will assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n. The variable n will store a different value every time you run this program. The output of the program should be: The string Last digit of, followed by: if the last digit of n is greater than 5: the string and is greater than 5, if the last digit of n is 0: the string and is 0, if the last digit of n is less than 6 and not 0: the string and is less than 6 and not 0, followed by a new line.</sub>

***2-print_alphabet.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code.</sub>

***3-print_alpahbets.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar three times in your code.</sub>

***4-print_alphabt.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line. Print all the letters except q and e. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code.</sub>

***5-print_numbers.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.</sub>

***6-print_numberz.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char. ou can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code.</sub>

***7-print_tebahpla.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar twice in your code.</sub>

***8-print_base16.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar three times in your code.</sub>

***9-print_comb.c***

<sub>Write a program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers. Numbers must be separated by ,, followed by a space. Numbers should be printed in ascending order. You can only use the putchar function (every other function (printf, puts, etc…) is forbidden). You can only use putchar four times maximum in your code. You are not allowed to use any variable of type char.</sub>
